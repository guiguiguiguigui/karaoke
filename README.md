## Run the lyrics generator
Currently the fine-tuned model lives in BMO. (TODO: make it a service???) Run the following command in the `\lyrics` directory.

`python inference.py new_titles.txt`
`python postprocess.py`

## Image generation

we will use [attnGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10485.pdf) and maybe do something similar to what goodkids did [here](https://neurips2019creativity.github.io/doc/Text%20Conditional%20Lyric%20Video%20Generation.pdf). The downloaded model also lives in BMO. Commands:

(in karaoke root directory) `python lyrics/preprocess.py`

`cd vis/AttnGAN/code`

`python2 main.py --cfg cfg/eval_coco.yml --gpu 0`

`./vis/AttnGAN/models/coco_AttnGAN2/example_captions/`

_new workflow !?_

`python generate_images.py`


## Midi generation

## Conda enviornment
For versioning consistency, this repo is designed to be run in a conda env.
After cloning, create the env by running:

`conda env create -f env-ubuntu.yml`

With the right yml file for the operating system. and then

`conda activate karaoke`

If you installed something, remember to update the yml file by running:

`conda env export > env-os.yml`

replace "os" with the os you are working in.
