desert de beber  
The path of the storm is a long way from here  
If you're gonna die I'll go to hell  
I won't die so I won't die  
I won't die 'til the day I die  
How can you matter so much when you're so damn hard to find  
I will make you a better man  
I won't kill you so I won't kill you  
I will make you a better man  
I won't kill you so I won't kill you  
I will make you a better man  
I won't kill you so I won't kill you  
I will make you a better man  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to  
I will get to

And a black belt  
And he lived in a house  
That he shared with his wife  
And he drank too much  
He decided to let him
