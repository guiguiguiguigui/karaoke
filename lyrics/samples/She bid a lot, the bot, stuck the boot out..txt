I can't take this day,  
And I can't bear to think about it  
And I know that you're not what I needed  
You're the sound of my voice,  
And I'm the sound of your voice  
And I can't take this day,  
And I can't bear to think about it  
And I know that you're not what I needed  
You're the sound of my voice,  
And I'm the sound of your voice  
And I can't take this day,  
And I can't bear to think about it  
And I know that you're not what I needed  
You're the sound of my voice,  
And I'm the sound of your voice  
And I can't take this day,  
And I can't bear to think about it  
And I know that you're not what I needed  
You're the sound of my voice,  
And I'm the sound of your voice
