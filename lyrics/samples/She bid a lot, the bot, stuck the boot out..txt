She bid a lot, the bot, stuck the boot out.

Oh, my darling,  
I've been waiting for you  
For a long, long time,  
I've been waiting for you,  
For a long, long time,  

Oh, my dear, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
The way you walk, the way you speak.  
Oh, my darling, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
The way you walk, the way you speak.  
Oh, my darling, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
The way you walk, the way you speak.  
Oh, my darling, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
The way you walk, the way you speak.  

And I know that you're not what I needed  
You're the sound of my voice,  
And I'm the sound of your voice  
And I can't take this day,  
And I can't bear to think about it  
You're the sound of my voice,  
And I'm the sound of your voice  

 
I'm in no hurry, my boy, I'm in no hurry.  
I\'ll lick you, you\'re gonna do me good.  
They said, No more questions, no more questions.  
I\'m going to dance to you, and I\'m going to dance to her.  
I\'m in no hurry, my boy, I'm in no hurry.
