Dust of stars, Surf the universe

Surf the universe
I've been waiting for a long time, so I'll be waiting  
For a long time, so I'll be waiting  
For a long, long time, so I'll be waiting  

This is your life and you are my life.  
It's the way I see it.  
But there's nothing I can do  
To change you.  
I can't stop you.  

You and I are the world,  
We're the world,  
The world is ours,  
You and all the world,  
The world is ours.  

Your body,  
Your mind,  
Your body,  
Your mind,  

But there's nothing I can do  
To change you.  
I can't stop you.  
You and I are the world,  
We're the world,
The world is ours.  
You and all the world,  
The world is ours.
