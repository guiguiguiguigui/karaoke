The truth is almost certain  
Next to him right there  
The time is over

You can be a real nice guy  
Use your body to do your thing  
But when you're playing this game  
And you're not a man  
You keep making money from any kind of game

Use your body to do your thing  
It's not just about you, it's about me  
It's not just about you, it's about me

It's the best kind of pussy  
I got a whole lot of money  
I don't care what we do  
I'm a real nice guy  

I make my livin'  
It's the best kind of pussy  
I got a whole lot of money  
I don't care what we do  
I'm a real nice guy  

The time to go  
The time to go  
The time to go  
The time to go
