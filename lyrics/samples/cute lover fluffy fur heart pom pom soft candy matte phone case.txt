Got no idea of what I was dreaming of  
I could have been a star  
Gotta see the stars  
Feeling safe  
In my arms  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  
Gotta see the stars  
Feeling safe  
In my arms  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  
The lights are bright  
I know  
I've got to be  


I am the prince of dreams  
There is no one who can change the desire  
I am the prince of dreams  
There is no one who can change the desire  
I am the prince of dreams  
There is no one who can change the desire
