That's a shame, but I'll do it  \nWhen we meet,  \nWhere we'll be together.  \n  \n[Chorus]\n\n"]
["I've been away for a pretty much one-time  \nThis town I have been to this place is so pretty  \nYou'd think it'd be cool if I could come back and do it all again  \nYou know what, I'm gonna do what I'm told  \nI've been all around to get this far  \nSo far and so far  \n  \nI just wanna see my friends all around  \nI don't mind the weather on this town  \nI just wanna see all the ladies up in this town  \n  \nI got a friend who lives with me in a place called The Castle  \nIn this town, we're all in this town  \nSo far and so far  \n  \nHere I come from home  \n  \nI got a friend who lives with me in a place called The Castle  \nIn this town, I get to see all the ladies up in this town  \nHe got me a friend who loves this town  \n  \nI get a friend who lives with me in a place called The Castle  \nIn this town, I got to see all the ladies up in this town\n\n"]
["You've been here before and now, I feel no trace  \nThat you're here for all that you've been  \nIt's been years I've been in love with you, and now, I am with you  \n  \nNo place in this universe where you'll never appear  \nDoesn't seem like this is a place that I want to be (yes)  \nThere's no place to go, I have found I don't know where  \nYes, the world that I've grown up in, I don't know what else (no other)  \n  \nI was a slave to my master and I've never been free  \nWhy is this what I've lived for?  \nYes, I've been living with you, my life has been in full order  \nNow I'm falling into love with you, I want you here  \nSo now, I'm lying on my side in this embrace  \nAnd I want to be with you for ever  \nNow I'm looking into this love that I am in all of my days  \nNo one can ever love another girl, when you see me  \nNo one could ever love another girl when you see me\n\n"]
["I've got the feeling there's never going to be a day off  \nI've gone sailing I've got the feeling there's never going to be a day of my life  \nThat I should be, I should be, it's been my life for so many years  \nI've got the feeling there's never going to get away  \nIt's so hard to do when you don't have the means  \nI can't help I know I'm so far away  \nThat I should be  \n  \n'Cause I won't go on like a child  \nNo, I won't go on like a child  \nMy eyes are wide open now, everything's changed, everything's gonna change in this world  \nIt's so hard to do when you don't have the means  \nDon't you know that I'm so far away  \nThat I should be  \n  \n'Cause I won't go on like a child  \nNo, I won't go on like a child  \nNo, I won't go on like a child  \nNo, I won't go on like a child\n\n"]
['When I first went to school, I was a poor little girl  \nI went to see a tailor, but he didn't look that good  \nBefore I could do any of these things, I got myself a tailor  \n  \nNow I'm not a rich man or a poor woman  \nBut I know I'm the best  \n  \nIt's the same old boy  \nYou want something good, you're the best  \nThe way you look can't be wrong  \n'Cause you're looking out for yourself.  \nYour money's in the bank  \nAnd the best you've got there's no way to stop  \n  \nI think some day you may just come home to me  \nAnd tell me what you think of it.  \nIt won't make you any money
