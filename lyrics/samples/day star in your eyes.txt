day star in your eyes  

Catch the train  
Traffic light  
Sleeping in the sun  
Baby  
Run, running  
Sleeping in the sun  
Baby  
Run, running  
Sleeping in the sun  
Baby  
Run, running  

I'm the one.  
I'm the one.  
I'm the one.  
I'm the one.  

Sleeping in the sun  
Baby  
Run, running  
Sleeping in the sun  
Baby  
Run, running  
Sleeping in the sun  
Baby, baby

Ooh you're the one, you're the one  
You're the one, you're the one  
You're the one, you're the one  
You're the one, you're the one
