The desert lives in your hair  
The desert lives in your hair  
You're the desert


It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
The desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
Well you're the desert  
You're the desert  
You're the desert  
You're the desert  
You're the desert  
I don't know where you are, I don't know where you are  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
Well you're the desert  
You're the desert  
You're the desert  
You're the desert  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
You're the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
You're the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're  
It's the desert, and I don't know where the hell you're


I've been waiting for you for a long time  
Trying to think of something that I could love  
But it's too late now  
Because you don't exist  
We can now live in peace and harmony  
And the sun will shine on the desert  
We can now live in peace and harmony  
We can now live in peace and harmony  
And the sun will shine on the desert  
We can now live in peace and harmony  
And the sun will shine on the desert  
We can now live in peace and harmony  
We can now live in peace and harmony


How can you turn around and look at me  
When you're looking at me now?  
I know you're looking at me now,  
You'll never come near me  
I know you're looking at me now  
Not only I know that you're looking at me now,  
But it's not enough for me  
That you've got to go  
You've got to find a way  
That I don't know about  
How can you turn around and look at me  
When you're looking at me now?  
I know you're looking at me now,  
But it's not enough for me,  
That you've got to go  
You've got to find a way  
That I don't know about  
But it's not enough for me,  
That you've got to go  
You've got to find a way  
That I don't know about


I love you, I love you,  
You are my love, I am your love,  
I am your love,  
You are my love, I am your love,  
I love you, I love you,  
You are my love, I am your love,  
You are my love, I am your love,  
You are my love, I am your love,  
I love you, I love you,  
You are my love, I am your love,  
I love you, I love you,  
I love you, I love you,  
I love you, I love you,  
I love you, I love you,
