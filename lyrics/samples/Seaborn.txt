Seaborn


I saw a woman  
Trying to go out with me  
She was just too tall to be who I was  
She got me a tattoo  
So she's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She got me a heart  
So she's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She got me a heart  
So she's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She got me a heart  
So she's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart  
She's got me a heart


On the street  
You and me  
The world has broken  
Wash the tears  
And I rain  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go  
You just won't say  
I let you go


And I see you  
You're such a good friend  
I guess I just can't see you  
The way you smile  
You look so lovely  
I think I'm gonna laugh  
I'm gonna cry  
I'm gonna cry  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy, just like you  
I'm gonna be happy,
