Livin' on the hood, on the hood, on the hood  
Believe it or not, believe that  
When you're gonna fuck with me  
I want to fuck with you  
My ass ain't got no guts  
Don't get one cheek  
Can't get one eye  
Can't get one good eye  
When you're gonna fuck with me  
I want to fuck with you  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
Can't get one good eye  
I want to fuck with you  
I want to fuck with you  
I wanna fuck with you  
I wanna fuck with you  
I wanna fuck with you  
I wanna fuck with you  
I want to fuck with you  
I want to fuck with you  
I wanna fuck with you


I got a tape of you  
I got a tape of you  
You're the best I've ever had  
You put me in a big house  
You put me in a big house  
We're sitting on the floor  
And we're sleeping  
I'm really tired  
We're sitting on the floor  
And we're sleeping  
I'm really tired  
My baby is sitting on the floor  
You put me in a big house  
You put me in a big house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
You put me in a big house  
You put me in a big house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
You put me in a big house  
You put me in a big house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
I'm gonna build a house  
You put me in a big house  
You put me in a big house
