My body is a battleground

ease to the woman in my arms  
I'm gonna dance  
I'm gonna dance  
I'm gonna dance  
I'm gonna dance  

Breaking the rules  
I'm breaking the rules  
I'm breaking the rules  
Breaking the rules  

No one is talking about you  
You're at the bottom of the pile  
Make up your mind, get your mind open  
Don't think about what's behind you  
You're out of the game.  
Stay on your feet, never go too far  
You're out of the game.  
Don't be afraid, if you don't wanna get high  
You're out of the game.  
Don't be afraid, you can't be so high  
You're out of the game.  
Stay on your feet, don't go too far  
You're out of the game.  
Don't be afraid, you can't be so high  
You're out of the game.  

There's a place for this little girl  
And there's a place for this little girl  
There's a place for this little girl  
And there's a place for this little girl  
There's a place for this little girl  
And there's a place for this little girl  
There's a place for this little girl  
And there's a place for this little girl  

I'm taking a break  
I'm taking a break  
I'm taking a break
