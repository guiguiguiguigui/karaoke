I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I'm in no doubt that you are my man  
I'll be right here with you  
I'll be there to take you home  
I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I will be right here with you  
I will be there to take you home  
I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
You are my man  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
You are my man  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
You are my man  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
You are my man  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me


I was just a young boy  
I was so young  
I thought I was a child,  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to say  
There's no way I'm gonna live  
I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to say  
There's no way I'm gonna live  
I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to say  
There's no way I'm gonna live  
I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to say  
There's no way I'm gonna live  
I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to say  
There's no way I'm gonna live  
I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to
