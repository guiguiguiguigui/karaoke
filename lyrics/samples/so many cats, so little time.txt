I'm a little bit older than you  
You're a little bit older than me  
Love is a little bit more than what we used to have  
I'm a little bit older than you (Yeah, yeah)  
You're a little bit older than me (Yeah)  
You're a little bit older than me (Yeah)  
Born in a very small town  
The buggers at the door  
Aren't you ashamed of me  
I can't take you anymore  
I can't take you anymore  
I can't take you anymore  
I can't take you anymore  
I can't take you anymore  
I can't take you anymore

I was out in the park, and I saw the girls  
I tried to help them, but they were so cold  
They were so cold, they were so cold  
So I drive off to the city  
I drive off to the city  
I drive off to the city  
I was in the park, and it was quite cold  
They were so cold, they were so cold  
So I drive off to the city  
I drive off to the city  
I drive off to the city  
I was out in the park, and it was quite cold  \
