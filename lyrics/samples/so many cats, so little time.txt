so many cats, so little time 

So many cats, so little time
I can't stop, I can't stop  
I can't stop, I can't stop  
So many cats, so little time
So many cats, so little time
I can't stop, I can't stop  
I can't stop, I can't stop  
So many cats, so little time
So many cats, so little time

I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I'll be right here with you
I'll be there to take you home

I can't stand the thought of you  
Cos I must have mistaken you for a man  
I must have taken you from me  
I will be right here with you  
I will be there to take you home  

I was so young  
I thought I was a child,  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live

I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  
I used to say  
There's no way I'm gonna live  

I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child  
And I never understood  
Why I came to live  

I used to think I was a child  
I used to think I was a child
